This is my first attempt to create a responsive web page using the following stack: HTML5+CSS3 (SASS + BEM), JavaScript (OOP), gulp build.
The server side is not finished, therefore it hadn't been uploaded to the repository.
The cart (basket) works only on the front side, however, I tried to make it workable. The search line also works.
